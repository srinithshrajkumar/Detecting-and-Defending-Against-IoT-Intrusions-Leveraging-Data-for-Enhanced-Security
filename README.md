# Detecting and Defending Against IoT Intrusions Leveraging Data for Enhanced Security

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning-based framework to detect and defend against intrusion attempts in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Using advanced data analysis and classification algorithms, the system leverages network traffic data to identify and classify malicious activities, enhancing the overall security of IoT infrastructures.

This work is being published in **Springer Nature SNAPP, Journal of Network and Systems Management**.
